# IA Assign 2 - Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes

## Grade: 18.5/20

## Description 

This project addresses a multi-class classification problem related to cirrhosis outcomes.  
We use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as **CatBoost**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM** to achieve high predictive performance.  
Additionally, we implemented an ensemble of weaker models — including **SVM**, **KNN**, **MLP**, **Extra Trees**, and **Decision Tree** — to further improve results through model combination.

The code is organized for easy experimentation and evaluation of different models, with clear metrics and visualizations for comparison.


## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- All the necessary dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
